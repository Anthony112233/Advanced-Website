	<h2> Playing Piano</h2>
	<p> I began playing piano when I was about 8 years old. However, my old teacher often called me a goat and very rarely gave any constructive criticism. That coupled with my hyperactice childhood self meant that I was not a fan of the piano initially. However, as I entered high school, I fell in love with piano and began taking lessons. I have been playing the piano for 3 years and have enjoyed every second. Here is a picture:   </p>

	<h2>My Dog</h2>
	<p> Ive had my dog for about 3 years. She is a German Shepherd that was rescued from a shelter at New Port Beach. She is really cool and chill. She never barks and never runs away. I hardly need to hold the leash when I walk her. She loves to chase after deers in my neighborhood. She is pretty chill. <br> <br> <br> <br> </p>
